# Network Training Api Example

## Example of an API that was used during the Networking Presentation

## How to use it:
-   Clone the repository
-   Run yarn install
-   Run yarn start
-   In Postman import the HTTP Demo.postman_collection.json file and experiment with those api calls. This file contains the API calls used in the presentation
-   Also you need to either replace {{Token}} with the one generated from the login request or create an environment in Postman and switch to it from the environment tab(top right) and a new variable will get generated automatically with the name Token and the value received from the login response. This will be used with every other requests.

If you have any questions or technical difficulties, message me anytime.
